## Pros of HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

1. `HTML` is easy to use and learn. It is the standard for creating websites and web applications.

2. `HTML` is supported by all major browsers, so it is easy to make your website look the same across all browsers.

3. `HTML` is a text-based language that is relatively easy to understand and edit.

4. `HTML` is free, open-source software that can be used to create basic websites and web applications.

## Cons of HTML:

1. `HTML` is not a programming language, so it cannot be used to create complex applications or websites.

2. `HTML` is limited in its ability to create dynamic content, so it is not suitable for complex web applications.

3. `HTML` requires a web server to host the website, which can be expensive.

4. `HTML` can be difficult to maintain and update, so it is important to keep the code organized and up-to-date.
